# Creational patterns

Set of patterns that create objects, rather than instantiating them directly.

* Abstract factory: groups object factories that have a common theme.
* Factory method: creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
* Builder: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
* Prototype: creates objects by cloning an existing object.
* Singleton: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
